Mind Mapping Planet Earth using Python, Jinja2, and restcountries.com

## Instructions

Virtual Environment

I recommend running jurassicPy in a Python virtual environment. This will help keep your host system clean and allow you to have multiple environments to try new things. If you are not using a virtual environment, start at the download/clone step below.

You will also need Python 3 and venv installed on your host system.

In your project directory, create your virtual environment
``` console
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate (use) your new virtual environment (Linux):
``` console
source env/bin/activate
```
Download or clone the mind_nmap repository:

``` console
git clone https://github.com/automateyournetwork/jurassicpy.git
```

## Run the code! 

```console
cd jurassicPy
cd MindMaps
python3 jurassicPy.py
```
